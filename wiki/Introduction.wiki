= What is gwt-cx? =
gwt-cx is an open-source Customer Experience (CX) framework, that provides you with the ability to quickly and cost-effectively create innovative customer experiences.

gwt-cx provides:

  *  *a core web-application* with rich feature set (including: authentication, localisation/multi-lingual, multi-page, data import/export).
  *  *a range of plug-in modules* to add common customer relationship management functionality (including; contacts, accounts, calendar, workflow, reports).
  *  *the ability to easily extend the framework* to add new modules to tailor unique customer experiences.


= Why gwt-cx? =
gwt-cx is designed for business innovators who understand that unlocking opportunity is driven by delivering a compelling customer experience, rather than reactive management of the customer relationship through legacy CRM systems.

gwt-cx aims to provide 80% of the functionality of your web application.  You choose the common functionality that suits your project by adding the appropriate modules.  The other 20% is added by configuring, customising or developing other modules to deliver an innovative, tailored customer experience specific to your industry.

This additive development model accelerates your development and reduces the time, cost and risk of your project, while enabling the development of innovative, differentiating processes to suit the desired outcome for your organisation.

gwt-cx aims to be an alternative to developing bespoke applications from scratch with web application frameworks or implementing expensive 3rd-party CRM applications which are not fit for purpose.
