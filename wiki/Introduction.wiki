= What is gwt-cx? =
gwt-cx an open-source Customer Experience framework, which enables organisations to quickly create compelling customer experiences that drive business value.

gwt-cx is designed for business innovators who understand that unlocking opportunity in today's increasingly competitive and rapidly changing marketplace is driven by delivering a compelling customer experience.

= Why customer experience innovation?=

So why customer experience innovation?
  * to create opportunities and drive business value

  * to support brand differentiation

  * to support customer segmentation strategies and a differentiated service offering per segment

  * to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing marketplace

  * to support a niche business requirements within a broader enterprise (e.g. private bank business unit within a retail bank)

= Why gwt-cx? =
Traditionally there are limited options that support customer experience innovation:

  # *develop a bespoke application from scratch.* This approach has the familiar drawbacks involving long development time, high costs and the risks of project failure.
  # *implement a 3rd party application*, such as a CRM system, and configure or customise within the system's constraints.  This approach may be expensive and the solution may not possess the required level of flexibility.

== gwt-cx ==
gwt-cx aims to be an alternative to starting from scratch, or utilising expensive, bloated propitiatory solutions.

Firstly, gwt-cx provides a fully-functional web application to use as a base for your project.  This removes the need to develop base application functions like authentication, multi-lingual and localisation support.

The web application can then be extended using a range of modules to add common features, such as contact management, calendar and reporting, which should provide the majority of the core functionality required.

This allows the main effort of your project to be focused on delivering your desired customer experience vision through configuration, extension and integration.

This additive development model accelerates development time, reduces the cost and risk of your project, while providing the required flexibility and freedom to innovate.
