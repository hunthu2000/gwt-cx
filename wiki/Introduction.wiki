= What is gwt-cx? =
gwt-cx is an open-source Customer Experience (CX) management framework, which enables you to quickly and cost-effectively create bespoke customer experiences.

To create a tailored customer experience:

  # Start with our base application
  # Use our plug-in the modules to add your desired functionality
  # Extend to meet your specific requirements

= Why gwt-cx? =
== Why deliver innovative customer experiences? ==
gwt-cx is designed for innovators who understand that unlocking business opportunity is driven by delivering a compelling customer experience, rather than reactive management of the customer relationship through legacy CRM systems.

There are a variety of reasons why you may wish to tailor the customer experience:

  * to innovate, create market opportunities and drive business value

  * to support a niche business within a broader enterprise (e.g. private bank business unit within a retail bank)

  * to support brand differentiation from competitors

  * to support a differentiated service offering based on customer segmentation (e.g. treat high value customers differently to low value customers)

  * to meet the evolving requirements of customers and the market

== How to deliver innovative customer experiences? ==
Traditionally there a couple of options to support a tailored customer experience:

  # *develop a bespoke application from scratch.* This approach has the familiar drawbacks involving long development time, high costs and the risks of project failure.
  # *implement a 3rd party application*, such as a CRM system, and configure or customise within the system constraints.  This approach may be expensive and the solution not flexible enough to enable the required level of differentiation.

== Why innovate customer experiences with gwt-cx ==
gwt-cx aims to be an alternative to these approaches. 

It eliminates the need to start from scratch by providing a fully-functional sample application to use as a base for your project.  Removing the need to develop core application functions like authentication, multi-lingual and localisation.

The base application can then be extended using a range of modules to add common features, such as contact management, calendar and reporting. This should provide the majority of your applications core functionality and allows you to focus on delivering the desired customer experience through configuration and customisation.

This additive development model accelerates development time and reduces the cost and risk of your project.
