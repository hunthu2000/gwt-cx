= What is gwt-cx? =
gwt-cx is an open-source Customer Experience (CX) framework, that provides you with the ability to quickly and cost-effectively create innovative customer experiences.

  # Start with our base application
  # Use our plug-in the modules to add the desired functionality
  # Extend to meet your specific requirements

= Why gwt-cx? =
gwt-cx is designed for innovators who understand that unlocking businesses opportunity is driven by delivering a compelling customer experience, rather than reactive management of the customer relationship through legacy CRM systems.

There are a variety of reasons why you may wish to tailor the customer experience:

  * to innovate and create market opportunities to drive business value

  * to support a niche business within a broader enterprise (e.g. private bank business unit within a retail bank)

  * to support brand differentiation from competitors

  * to support a differentiated service offering based on customer segmentation (e.g. treat high value customers differently to low value customers)

  * to meet the evolving requirements of customers and market changes


Traditionally there a couple of options to support a tailored customer experience:

  # *implement a 3rd party application, such as a CRM system*, and configure, customise or extend it.  This approach may be expensive and not allow for the necessary level of flexibility or the required differentiation.
  # *develop a bespoke application from scratch.* This approach has the familiar drawbacks involving high development time, costs, risks and project failure.

gwt-cx aims to be an alternative to these approaches. 

It enables quick and cost-effectively create innovative customer experiences by providing the majority of the common functionality needed in a typical application.  The remainder is added by configuring, customising or developing new modules to support your desired customer experience.

This additive development model accelerates development time and reduces the cost and risk of your project.
