= What is gwt-cx? =
gwt-cx is an open-source Customer Experience (CX) framework, that provides you with the ability to quickly and cost-effectively create innovative customer experiences.

  # Start with our base application
  # Use our plug-in the modules to add the desired functionality
  # Extend to meet your specific requirements

= Why gwt-cx? =
gwt-cx is designed for innovators who understand that unlocking businesses opportunity is driven by delivering a compelling customer experience, rather than reactive management of the customer relationship through legacy CRM systems.

Businesses may wish to tailor customer experiences for a variety of reasons:

  * to innovate and create market opportunities to drive business value

  * to support a niche business within the broader enterprise (e.g. private bank business unit within a retail bank)

  * to to differentiate their offering based on customer segmentation (e.g. treat high value customers differently to low value customers)

  * to support brand differentiation from competitors

  * to meet the evolving requirements of customers and market changes

To do this businesses have a couple of options:

  # implement a 3rd party application, such as a CRM system, and configure, customise or extend it.  This approach may be expensive and not allow for the necessary level of flexibility or the required differentiation.
  # develop a bespoke application from scratch. This approach has the familiar drawbacks involving development time and risks. Consider the odds - approximately half of all projects are cancelled in development. Of the survivors, another half are late, over budget, and do not meet requirements. Of the remainder (less than 25% of all projects) that make it to production, the majority incur major costs through downtime, lost revenue, and maintenance costs.

gwt-cx aims to be an alternative to these approaches by providing a state of the art web application and a range of plug in modules to provide 80% of the common functionality of your web application.  The other 20% is added by configuring, customising or developing other modules to deliver your innovative, tailored customer experience specific to your brand or industry.  This additive development model accelerates development time and reduces the cost and risk of your project.
